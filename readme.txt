# Prediction Models Basics

> A regression model provides a function that describes the relationship
> between one or more independent variables and a response, dependent,
> or target variable.

A regression analysis is the basis for many types of prediction and for determining the effects on target variables. When you hear about studies on the news that talk about fuel efficiency, or the cause of pollution, or the effects of screen time on learning, there is often a regression model being used to support their claims.

According to [analytics vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/08/comprehensive-guide-regression/) there are various kinds of regression techniques available to make predictions but the majority of them are driven by three metrics:

There are many regression models, in this project I will only introduce you to the most commonly used wich is: 

 - Linear Regression
 -  Logistic Regression
 - Polynomial Regression
 - Stepwise Regression
 - Ridge Regression

And some other types of predictions like Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
