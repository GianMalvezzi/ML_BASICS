# Linear Regression

> Linear regression is called "linear" because the relationship of the response to the variables is thought to be a linear function of some parameters.

When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as  **simple linear regression**. When there are  **multiple input variables**, literature from statistics often refers to the method as multiple linear regression.
