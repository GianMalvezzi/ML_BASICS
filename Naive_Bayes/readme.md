# Naive Bayes

The Naive Bayes multinomial classifier is one of the most popular models in machine learning. Assuming independence between the variables in the problem, the Na√Øve Bayes model performs a probabilistic classification of observations, characterizing them into pre-defined classes.
As a model suitable for classification of discrete attributes, Naive Bayes has applications in credit analysis, medical diagnostics, or searching for faults in mechanical systems.
