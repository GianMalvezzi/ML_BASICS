In machine learning, tasks are generally classified into broad categories. These categories are based on how learning is received or how feedback on the learning is given to the system developed.

## Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the computer is provided with example inputs that are labeled with their desired outputs. The purpose of this method is for the algorithm to be able to “learn” by comparing its actual output with the “taught” outputs to find errors, and modify the model accordingly. Supervised learning therefore uses patterns to predict label values on additional unlabeled data.

## Unsupervised Learning
In unsupervised learning, data is unlabeled, so the learning algorithm is left to find commonalities among its input data. As unlabeled data are more abundant than labeled data, machine learning methods that facilitate unsupervised learning are particularly valuable.

# The project itself
The project aims to learn the basics of ML models using scikit learn and tensorflow library, which in this case are:

 - SVM (Support Vector Machine)
 - Linear Regression
 - Logistic Regression
 - KNN (K Nearest Neighbors)
 - Naive Bayes
 - Decision Tree
 - Decision Tree (Random Forest)
 - Simple Neural Network
