# Neural Network

Neural networks, that were actually inspired by the human brain’s neurons are a buzzword these days because of their ability to do an amazing amount of work in various domains. Here I am not going to dive into the in-depth theory of neural networks, but for understanding the code some basic concepts will be explained. For a deeper understanding, this article won’t be just enough, you have to go through some standard materials that are present. Saying so, let me concisely explain some concepts.

1.**Input Layer** – This is the gateway for the inputs that we feed.

2.**Hidden layers**  – The layer where complex computations happen. The more your model has hidden layers, the more complex the model will be. This is kind of like a black box of the neural network where the model learns complex relations present in the data.

3.**Output Layer**  – From the diagram given above there is only one node in the output layer, but don’t think that it is always like that in every neural network model. The number of nodes in the output layer basically depends upon the problem that we have taken. If it’s a classification model, the number of nodes in the output layer will be equal to the number of classes that we want to predict.
